# Red Team Tools Guide


<!--[!NOTE]--> 
> **_NOTE_**: 
> * This repository was build with the intent of serving as a guide for my Cybersecurity Master's final exercise Blue Teams vs Red Team.
> * Use the hiperlinks to navigate between the different pentesting phases

<br>

This repository is a collection of helpful information to act as a Red Teamer. The primary goal here is to organize selected tools, tactics, and procedures to act efficiently and effectively during the engagement between the different pentesting phases.


This repository is structured to provide quick access to:

* **Tool Lists:** Curated lists of tools, categorized by the standard penetration testing phases.
* **Cheat Sheets:** Quick-reference summaries of instructions and commands for executing key tools.
* **Exercise Write-ups:** Examples and walkthroughs from our course exercises to use as playbooks. 
* **External References:** A collection of links to other useful pentesting resources, tools, and guides.
