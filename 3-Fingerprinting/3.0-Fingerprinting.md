# Fingerprinting

Fingerprinting involves collecting information, but unlike footprinting, it requires interaction with the system being analyzed. By doing so, someone can obtain information about the web browser, operating system and other device characteristics to create a complete profile of their target. Using this technique, users can be tracked and information about their online behavior can be collected without their explicit consent. This information could be used, for example, to discover a method of accessing a system.


-- Fingerprinting Phases:
 - Scanning
 - Vunerability analysis
 - Enumeration

- Active Fingerprinting
    - nmap
    - Nessus
    - OpenVas

- Passive Fingerprinting
    - p0f
    - tcpdump
    - wireshark
