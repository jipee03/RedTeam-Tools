# Fingerprinting

Fingerprinting is the phase where the attacker moves from broad reconnaissance to specific technical profiling. The objective is to identify the exact software applications, operating system versions, and configurations running on the target network.

An attacker constructs this "digital fingerprint" by analyzing the system's unique characteristics—whether by actively sending queries to interpret response behavior or by passively monitoring traffic patterns (such as TTL values and window sizes). This high-fidelity data allows the Red Team to map the attack surface and select precise exploits that match the identified versions, minimizing the risk of failed attacks.

It is crucial to understand the two approaches to Fingerprinting:

<p align="center">

| Type | Description | Key Tools | Risk Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Active Fingerprinting** | Sending specially crafted packets (e.g., malformed TCP probes) to the target and analyzing the response. There's a direct communication with the target. Packets are sent and response is being analyzed. | `Nmap`, `Nessus`, `Amap`, `Wappalyzer` (CLI) | **High** (Logs generated) |
| **Passive Fingerprinting** | Sniffing network traffic without sending packets. There's no direct communication with the target because only the packets on the local network are being analyzed. | `p0f`, `Wireshark`, `NetworkMiner` | **Low** (Silent) |

The Fingerprinting stage is not a random execution of tools; it follows a strict logical sequence known as the "Funnel of Discovery." We must first find the door (Scanning), check if the lock is broken (Vulnerability Analysis), and finally peek inside to see who lives there (Enumeration):

<br>

### 1. Scanning
**Application:** This phase transitions from broad network ranges to specific targets. The objective is to determine the network topology, identify "Live" hosts within the CIDR blocks, and map every listening service (Port) to create a comprehensive list of potential entry points.

- **[Passive Scanning](3.1-Tools.md#11-passive-scanning):** Use this when you cannot afford to be detected. We listen to ARP and Broadcast traffic to find hosts silently.
    * **Arsenal:** 

- **[Active Scanning](./3.1-Tools.md#21-active-scanning):** Use this to rigorously map the entire subnet when noise is acceptable.
    * **Arsenal:**

### 2. Vulnerability Analysis
**Application:** Once the services are mapped, we correlate their specific version numbers (e.g., Apache 2.4.49) against known vulnerability databases (NVD, Exploit-DB). The goal is to identify CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) or misconfigurations that can be weaponized into a shell, prioritizing "Remote Code Execution" over low-impact bugs.

- **[Passive Analysis](./3.1-Tools.md#12-passive-vulnerability-analysis):** Identify outdated software by reading unencrypted server banners and HTTP headers.
    * **Arsenal:** 
- **[Active Analysis](./3.1-Tools.md#22-active-vulnerability-analysis):** Send malicious packets to prove a flaw exists (e.g., sending a payload to check for RCE).
    * **Arsenal:** 

### 3. Enumeration
**Application:** This is the most intrusive and high-value pre-exploitation phase. Unlike scanning (which asks "Is port 445 open?"), enumeration asks "What data is inside?". We actively query the application logic to extract usernames, machine names, network shares, and routing tables, often utilizing the protocol's own features against itself.

- **[Passive Enumeration](./3.1-Tools.md#13--passive-enumeration):** Harvest user data from broadcast protocols (LLMNR/NBT-NS) without poisoning them.
    * **Arsenal:** 
- **[Active Enumeration](./3.1-Tools.md#23-active-enumeration):** Connect to SMB, SNMP, or LDAP to dump the database.
    * **Arsenal:**
