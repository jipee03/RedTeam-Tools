# Footprinting

Footprinting is the first phase of penetration testing where the attacker systematically collects information about a target organization, network, or system **using passive techniques** that do not directly interact with the target's infrastructure in order to avoid trigger an IDS/IPS. It relies on publicly available information and intermediary services (Google, WHOIS databases, Shodan), it does not require sending packets directly to the target. This makes it undetectable by the target's security systems.

| Information Type | Examples |
|------------------|----------|
| **Network** | IP ranges, domain names, DNS records, network topology |
| **Organization** | Employee names, emails, job roles, org structure |
| **Infrastructure** | Web technologies, mail servers, hosting providers |
| **Public Data** | Documents, metadata, social media, leaked credentials |

Based on the information provided by the table above we can separate the information in two distinct operational areas.

### 1. [OSINT & Public Data](./01-OSINT-Public-Data.md)
* **Focus:** Search engines, Social Media, Job boards, IoT Search.
* **Key Tools:** Google Dorks, Shodan, theHarvester, Sherlock.

### 2. [Infrastructure Reconnaissance](./02-Infrastructure-Recon.md)
* **Focus:** Technical mapping of the network, DNS, and Email systems.
* **Key Tools:** Whois, Dig, DNSRecon, Traceroute, MXToolbox.
