# Footprinting

Footprinting is the first phase of penetration testing where the attacker **systematically collects information about a target organization, network, or system using passive techniques** that do not directly interact with the target's infrastructure in order to avoid trigger an IDS/IPS. It relies on publicly available information and intermediary services (Google, WHOIS databases, Shodan), it does not require sending packets directly to the target. This makes it undetectable by the target's security systems.

| Information Type | Examples |
|------------------|----------|
| **Network** | IP ranges, domain names, DNS records, network topology |
| **Organization** | Employee names, emails, job roles, org structure |
| **Infrastructure** | Web technologies, mail servers, hosting providers |
| **Public Data** | Documents, metadata, social media, leaked credentials |

Based on the information provided by the table above we can separate the information in two distinct operational areas.

### 1. [OSINT & Public Data](./2.1-Tools.md#1-osint--public-data-gathering)
* **Application:** Before touching the network, we must expand the attack surface. We use this domain to harvest employee emails for phishing campaigns and locate leaked credentials (passwords) from previous breaches. This is the "Human" side of reconnaissance.
* **Arsenal:** [Google Dorks](./2.1-Tools.md#google-hacking-dorks), [theHarvester](./2.1-Tools.md#theharvester), [Sherlock](./2.1-Tools.md#sherlock), [Maltego](./2.1-Tools.md#maltego).

### 2. [Infrastructure Reconnaissance](./2.1-Tools.md#2-infrastructure-reconnaissance)
* **Application:** We use this domain to map the Network Topology. The goal is to identify the IP ranges (CIDR) owned by the target, their Mail Servers, and their DNS structure to find hidden sub-domains that might be vulnerable.
* **Arsenal:** [Traceroute](./2.1-Tools.md#traceroute-network-path-mapping), [Whois](./2.1-Tools.md#whois-ownership), [Dig](./2.1-Tools.md#dig-dns-mapping), [DNSenum](./2.1-Tools.md#dnsenum-dns-mapping), [Shodan](./2.1-Tools.md#shodan).

### 3. [Target Analysis](./2.1-Tools.md#3--target-analysis)
* **Application:** Instead of directly scanning the server (which creates logs), we query third-party databases and historical records to build a profile of the target's software. The goal is to identify outdated technologies, previous hosting providers (to find Origin IPs), and forgotten sub-systems known as "Shadow IT" without sending a single packet to the target.
* **Arsenal:** [Foca](./2.1-Tools.md#foca), [BuiltWith](./2.1-Tools.md#builtwith).
