# Exploitation

Exploitation is the critical phase where the attacker actively capitalizes on vulnerabilities identified during fingerprinting to establish access to the target system. Unlike previous phases, this involves aggressive interaction that breaches security boundaries to execute arbitrary code, bypass authentication, or acquire unauthorized privileges. Success in this phase transforms a "potential risk" into a "compromised asset".

| Attack Vector | Target Area | Examples |
|------------------|-------------|----------|
| **System/Service** | Memory, OS Kernels, Running Services | Buffer Overflows, Stack Smashing, ROP Chains |
| **Web Application** | Web Servers, APIs, Databases | SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, RCE |
| **Authentication** | Login Forms, Hashes, Keys | Brute-force, Credential Stuffing, Hash Cracking |
| **Client-Side** | Browsers, Document Readers, Humans | Phishing, Malicious Macros, Drive-by Downloads |
| **Malware/Evasion** | Antivirus, EDR, Firewalls | Obfuscation, Encoding (Shikata_ga_nai), Packing |

The following Exploitational operational areas were identified:

### [Exploiting Vulnerabilities](Exploiting_Vulnerabilities.md)
* **Application:** Use this when you identify a specific running service (e.g., SMB, FTP, Apache) that is outdated or unpatched. The goal is to execute a Buffer Overflow or Remote Code Execution (RCE) to gain an initial shell on the server.
* **Arsenal:** 

### [Malware & Antivirus Evasion](Malware-Invasion.md)
* **Application:** Essential when the target has active endpoint protection (Defender/EDR). We cannot simply upload raw binaries; we must obfuscate, encode, or pack our payloads to bypass signature-based detection before execution.
* **Arsenal:** 

### [Client-Side Exploitation](Client-Side.md)
* **Application:** Use this when the external server perimeter is hardened and unhackable. We shift focus to attacking the human or their workstation by sending malicious files (PDFs/Macros) or browser-hooking links.
* **Arsenal:** 

### [Password Attacks](Password_Attacks.md)
* **Application:** Use this to recover credentials for legitimate access. This includes "Online" attacks against login portals (ssh/http) and "Offline" attacks against stolen password hashes (NTLM/Shadow files).
* **Arsenal:** 

### [Web Exploitation](Web_Exploitation.md)
* **Application:** The most common entry point today. We manipulate web inputs to trick the server into executing commands or revealing data. We look for SQL Injection or RCE.
* **Arsenal:**  

### [Privilege Escalation](Privilege-Escalation.md)
* **Application:** Getting a shell is only half the battle. Use this to move vertically from a low-privileged user to Root or System by exploiting Kernel vulnerabilities or Sudo misconfigurations.
* **Arsenal:**
