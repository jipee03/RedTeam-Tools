# Exploitation

Exploitation is the critical phase where the attacker actively capitalizes on vulnerabilities identified during fingerprinting to establish access to the target system. Unlike previous phases, this involves aggressive interaction that breaches security boundaries to execute arbitrary code, bypass authentication, or acquire unauthorized privileges. Success in this phase transforms a "potential risk" into a "compromised asset".

| Attack Vector | Target Area | Examples |
|------------------|-------------|----------|
| **System/Service** | Memory, OS Kernels, Running Services | Buffer Overflows, Stack Smashing, ROP Chains |
| **Web Application** | Web Servers, APIs, Databases | SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, RCE |
| **Authentication** | Login Forms, Hashes, Keys | Brute-force, Credential Stuffing, Hash Cracking |
| **Client-Side** | Browsers, Document Readers, Humans | Phishing, Malicious Macros, Drive-by Downloads |
| **Malware/Evasion** | Antivirus, EDR, Firewalls | Obfuscation, Encoding (Shikata_ga_nai), Packing |

The following operational areas were identified:

### [Exploiting Vulnerabilities](Exploiting_Vulnerabilities.md)
* **Application:** Leverage known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in services, applications, or operating systems identified during fingerprinting. This includes researching public exploits, using exploitation frameworks, and executing attacks against outdated or misconfigured services (SMB, FTP, SSH, RDP) to gain initial access.
* **Arsenal:** Metasploit, SearchSploit, Exploit-DB, Nuclei, Nmap NSE, CrackMapExec, Impacket

### [Malware & Payload Delivery](Malware-Invasion.md)
* **Application:** Generate, obfuscate, and deliver malicious payloads to establish remote access. This includes creating reverse shells, evading antivirus/EDR detection through encoding and packing, and setting up Command & Control (C2) infrastructure for persistent communication.
* **Arsenal:** Msfvenom, Veil, Shellter, ScareCrow, Sliver, Cobalt Strike, Netcat, Chisel

### [Client-Side Attacks](Client-Side.md)
* **Application:** Target end users when direct server exploitation is not feasible. This involves crafting phishing campaigns, weaponizing documents with malicious macros, creating fake login pages, and exploiting browser vulnerabilities to compromise user workstations and harvest credentials.
* **Arsenal:** GoPhish, Evilginx2, SET, Macro Pack, BeEF, HTA payloads

### [Password Attacks](Password_Attacks.md)
* **Application:** Obtain valid credentials through online attacks (brute-forcing login services) or offline attacks (cracking captured hashes). Includes dictionary attacks, password spraying, and rule-based cracking against various authentication mechanisms and hash types.
* **Arsenal:** Hydra, Hashcat, John the Ripper, CeWL, CUPP, Crunch

### [Web Exploitation](Web_Exploitation.md)
* **Application:** Exploit vulnerabilities in web applications (aka the most common attack surface in modern environments). This includes injection attacks (SQL, command, XSS), authentication bypasses, file inclusion, and exploiting misconfigurations to extract data or achieve remote code execution.
* **Arsenal:** Burp Suite, SQLMap, ffuf, Gobuster, Nikto, WPScan, Nuclei

### [Privilege Escalation](Privilege-Escalation.md)
* **Application:** Elevate access from an initial low-privileged foothold to administrative/root level. This involves enumerating system misconfigurations, exploiting SUID binaries, abusing sudo permissions, leveraging kernel vulnerabilities, and exploiting weak service permissions.
* **Arsenal:** LinPEAS, WinPEAS, Linux Exploit Suggester, PowerUp, Mimikatz, GTFOBins
